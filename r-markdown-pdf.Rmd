This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
topol <- c('core', 'socket', 'node')
net <- c('gig', 'infin')
pml <- c('ob1', 'ucx')
btl <- c('vader','tcp' ,'openib')
to <- topol[1] 
ne <- net[1]
pm <- pml[1]
bt <- btl[1]
setwd(paste("~/Pubblici/learn-git/data_col_mpi/topo-",
            to,"/net-",ne,"/pml-",pm,"/btl-",bt,sep=''))


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
